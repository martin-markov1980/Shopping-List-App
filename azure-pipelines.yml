# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- master

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
- script: echo Hello, world!

# Step 2: Install Node.js (Use version 18.x, required for Playwright)

    versionSpec: '18.x'  # Ensure Node.js 18.x is installed
